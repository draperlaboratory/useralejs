UserAle.JS has become a component of Apache SensSoft -- an official Apache
Incubator project.

The new official repository has therefore been relocated to:

  https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-senssoft-useralejs.git

This is mirrored to Github at the following location:

  https://github.com/apache/incubator-senssoft-useralejs

The UserAle.JS website currently remains at:

  http://draperlaboratory.github.io/useralejs/

But will soon be moved to:

  http://senssoft.incubator.apache.org

- August 2016
